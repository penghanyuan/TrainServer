# TrainServer
This project is my graduation project in BIT (Beijing Institute of Technology).

## Tech
- Java
- SSM framework (Spring+ Spring MVC + Mybatis)
- MySQL
- Tomcat Web Server

## Description
This project is a Java server of an IOS application but it can also be the server of a web application or an android application. This server can be used by clients of train buy service and products online. After entering the mobile Internet era, people's demand for the Internet has become more complicated. People want to be able to enjoy any service in all aspects of the life by using mobile devices. Various types of mobile APPs have been developed because of those demands. In recent years, as people's living standards gradually improved, the demand for travel is increasing. Because of that, APPs for travel are very popular. In China, high-speed rail transport is an important tool for people to travel, users of high-speed rail may have a variety of needs of services, for example, in the train station, passengers probably carry a lot of luggage, they may need the porter service. But the services of the "little Red Riding Hood" in the station are not standardized, it may cause a lot of problems. This issue is mainly based on the IOS platform to build high-speed train service APP by learning DIDI taxi service model to make it possible for users to order the "Little Red Riding Hood" service (the porter service) before they are leaving or arriving.I use Java language and the SSM framework to develop server side; use MySQL database; and use a third party communication services to achieve order, log in, real-time communication, fulfill orders and other functions. 

## Instalation
Install the server in a Tomcat server and use the controllers to connect with your application.
